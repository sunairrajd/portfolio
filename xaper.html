    <h6 class=" mb-1 project-page-heading"> Introduction</h6>
    <p class="project-page-text mb-5 mt-3">During college, with two other classmates, I worked on setting
    up a small company that sold affordable sketchbooks(offline) subsidised by advertisements from partnered local restaurants and
    businesses.

    </p>

    <h6 class=" mb-1 project-page-heading"> Context</h6>
    <p class="project-page-text mb-5 mt-3">Being in an architecture college, sketchbooks were something that could be found in every students backpack and being used throughout the academic year. These sketchbooks varied in size from A5, A4, and A3.
  Although they were on always on demand, the price of the sketchbooks were not cheap and usually monopolized by big companies
    </p>


        <h6 class=" mb-1 mt-3 project-page-heading"> Product</h6>
<p class="project-page-text mb-5">We wanted to make cheaper sketchbooks for everyone to use and sell them less than all other sketchbook brands. The price of these sketchbooks were subsidised by the advertisements from local(wellknow) food joints, bakeries and computer shops that students from our college often visit order.(This was pre-online delivery)</p>

<p class="project-page-tag text-center my-1">Few of our products</p>


<p class="project-page-text my-5">We started off by manufacturing the entire sketchbooks range from scratch. Our college(in delhi) being close to the stationey manufactiuring market(Old city), we used to spend our long breaks between classes traveling to 'Paharganj' and enquiring/sourcing material, people who manufacture them.
</p>

<p class="project-page-tag text-center my-1">Pocket friendly product</p>


<p class="project-page-text my-5">For most of the initial months, All our saturdays and holidays were spent in the gullies of Nai sarak, sourcing paper, cutting them, printing covers, transporting and assembling them. Looking back, It was not very smart work</p>


<img src="xaper/b.jpg" class="d-block" style="image-size:contain; width:100%;"/>
<p class="project-page-tag text-center my-2">Advertisements and coupons in the sketchbook</p>


<p class="project-page-text my-5"> By doing most of the work ourself, we could reduce the manufacturing price of each sketchbook considerably. We sold the sketchbooks at a very competitive price without generating much profits</p>
<img src="xaper/h.jpg" class="mt-4 d-block" style="image-size:contain; width:100%;"/>
<p class="project-page-tag text-center my-2">Snapshots we took at Hampi & Belur</p>



      <h6 class=" mb-1 project-page-heading">Conclusion</h6>

      <p class="project-page-text mb-4">We sucessfully sold 4000+ copies of sketchbooks of various sizes before the academic year ended. We also tried selling our products outside across stationery shops in Jamia Univ, Indraprastha(I.T.O) and others.   </p>

    <p class="project-page-text mb-4">The local restaurants and bakery stores never gave us our comisssion, although we provided them with a lot of sales through our products :(  </p>


<p class="project-page-text mb-5">We learned a lot of new things starting up something. We never considered sales as something important and thought by pricing lower, we would sell could sell products like hot cakes. It didnt'. We had to stockpile a lot of sketchbooks for the enitre semester. Small margins multiplied over the quantity of products will yield big differences. Retail is very big ecosystem in itself, housing many small players before the products gets delivered to the end user </p>
